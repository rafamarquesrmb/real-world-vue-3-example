# Simple Real World Vue Example

  

<sub>by [Rafael Marques @rafamarquesrmb](https://github.com/rafamarquesrmb)</sub>

This is a very simple project, with the objective of demonstrating what a [SPA in Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) would look like in a real world project.

Contains the main functionality used in SPAs of real Vue3 projects:
- Use of routes, using "[vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/)"
- Data consumption through an external api, using "[axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)"

"[My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/)" was used to serve a Fake API with data in JSON format to be consumed by the app.
