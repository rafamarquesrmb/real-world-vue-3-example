# Simple Real World Vue Example

  

  

<sub>by [Rafael Marques @rafamarquesrmb](https://github.com/rafamarquesrmb)</sub>

  

This is a very simple project, with the objective of demonstrating what a [SPA in Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) would look like in a real world project.

  

Contains the main functionality used in SPAs of real Vue3 projects:

- Use of routes, using "[vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/)"
	- receiving url params
	- pagination
	- nested routes
	- redirects
- Not found and Network Error page
- Usage of flash messages
- Usage of progress bar with nprogress
- Basic usage of global store (with vuex)
- Route Meta Fields
- Lazy Loading Routes
- Scroll Behavior
- Data consumption through an external api, using "[axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)"


  

"[My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/)" was used to serve a Fake API with data in JSON format to be consumed by the app.
